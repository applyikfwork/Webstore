## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated teal (#008080) for a calming but modern feel, drawing inspiration from digital agency portfolio pieces. This teal complements the green in the prompt and balances it with a dark base, making it feel professional.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated cyan (#0A192F) to maintain a dark theme and give the impression of sophistication.
- Accent color: Bright lime green (#32CD32) as an accent to highlight key interactive elements, standing out against the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface.
- Minimal, outlined icons for a clean and modern look.
- Clean, card-based layout for app listings, with clear separation of elements.
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions (e.g., hover effects on cards).
